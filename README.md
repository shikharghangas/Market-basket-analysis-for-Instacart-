## Executive Summary

The Instacart Market Analysis project focuses on optimizing the operational efficiency, customer experience, and inventory management of the online delivery service Instacart. We leverage a dataset of over 3 million grocery orders from Kaggle, aiming to address challenges such as order cancellations, delivery delays, and inefficient demand-supply management. Through descriptive, prescriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics, we extract insights that can lead to innovative solutions for customer retention.

Our new solution design incorporates advanced machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting Machines and Random Forests, to enhance the accuracy of predicting item reorders. It seamlessly integrates into Instacart's existing IT architecture, supporting real-time predictions and personalized product recommendations. Additionally, we propose a cloud-based scalable infrastructure to handle large data volumes efficiently, enabling a user-friendly virtual grocery store layout and real-time product information.

Periodic model training, refinement, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning can further improve solution accuracy, precision, and recall, ultimately enhancing inventory management and supply chain strategies for Instacart.

## Introduction

This section provides an overview of the approaches and algorithms implemented to improve inventory management and supply chain strategies at Instacart. We focus on predicting item reorders to optimize operational efficiency, prevent stockouts, and minimize overstocking. By addressing key challenges and leveraging descriptive, prescriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics, we aim to enhance the overall performance of the virtual grocery store.

## Business Problem Overview

Instacart, a leading player in online grocery delivery, seeks to strengthen its operational capabilities and customer experience. Key challenges include accurately forecasting demand, optimizing pricing, reducing order cancellations, and minimizing delivery wait times. By leveraging data-informed insights, Instacart aims to enhance supply and demand management, collaboration, and customer retention. The analysis focuses on using past performance data, customer preferences, and item details to provide relevant predictions that improve the shopping experience and position Instacart as a customer-driven platform.

## Analytics Questions

We address critical business questions using different types of analytics:

- Descriptive Analytics: Identify top-selling products and assess their contribution to revenue generation.
- Prescriptive Analytics: Analyze pricing flexibility and optimize pricing strategies for improved profitability.
- Diagnostic Analytics: Identify reasons for order cancellations and develop solutions to control them.
- Predictive Analytics: Analyze customer buying habits to predict potential future purchases.
- Diagnostic Analytics: Investigate factors leading to delivery delays and implement necessary improvements.

## Scope Statement

Our project scope entails creating and deploying innovations within Instacart's online grocery delivery platform to enhance customer satisfaction, streamline processes, improve partner cooperation, optimize costs and returns, and explore potential new markets. Acceptance criteria include improved customer satisfaction metrics, reduced order fulfillment errors, and a reliable inventory management system.

## Data Sources, Key Data Entities, and Flows

We source data from Kaggle, including over 3 million grocery orders with information on products, customers, and orders. Key data entities include aisles, departments, orders, products, and more. Data flows involve customer orders, inventory systems, market analysis, order processing, and the Instacart database.

## Brief Overview of Data Manipulation Process and Data Output

Data manipulation processes include data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization. We provide visualizations and insights into buying patterns, order distribution, and customer behavior. Data output includes charts and graphs showcasing product variety, order patterns, and department analysis.

## New Solution Design and Its Fit into the Existing IT Architecture

Our new solution design includes data collection, feature engineering, advanced machine learning models, real-time prediction capabilities, and scalable cloud-based infrastructure. The solution enhances department ordering and implements electronic shelf labels. It fits seamlessly into Instacart's existing IT architecture, improving customer experience and operational efficiency.

## New Solution Implementation and Outcome Testing

We conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize buying patterns, order distribution, and department performance. Outcome testing compares prior data with the implemented solution, showcasing improvements in predicting item reorders. We also introduce enhanced department ordering and electronic shelf labels to optimize the customer experience.

## Potential Solution Optimization

To optimize our solution, we recommend feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model selection, ensemble methods, data augmentation, cross-validation, iterative refinement, and continuous monitoring. These steps can enhance prediction accuracy and overall performance.
